This thesis is written as part of the completion of the Bachelor of Computer Science (``Informatik'') by Bennett Piater and Lukas Krismer.

We chose this topic because we already used Arch Linux including the AUR and are generally interested in security. As users of the AUR we wanted to make it more secure, not only for us, but for all users.

We want to thank Christian Sillaber for his supervision and
and our families and friends for their support.
We want to specially thank Justus Piater for his comments on how to improve the structure of the paper, Sara Bauer for her correction of our use of the English language, and Alad Wenter for his help during the integration with the AUR helper \texttt{aurutils}.

\label{sec:tui}
\texttt{aursec-tui} is a urwid-based Python script. The TUI gives an overview over all mined blocks, their hashes, the miner of the block and any transactions which are saved in the block.

It is split in two parts. The first part is needed to gain the data from the blockchain and save it, the other part formats the information and displays it.
To display the results as fast as possible, the data is fetched in a background thread.
Any additional data will be displayed after the next refresh.
The script offers the user two settings for filtering the results:
\emph{only mine} shows all blocks which were mined by the user himself,
while \emph{only transactions} shows all blocks which contains at least one transaction.
The settings can be combined with the result that all blocks mined by the user and containing transactions will be displayed.
All hash-commit transactions are parsed into readable text.
Any other transaction is shown with the text \emph{``Transaction is no hash-commit''}.

This open-source project (github.com/clawoflight/aursec) was done by three people: Two students who implemented the tool and their supervisor. This required considerable communication and time management.

\subsubsection*{timeline}
From the timeline (Figure \ref{fig:timeline}) can be derived that this project was realized in less than 9 months. The visualized work time is the timespan but not the time effort. In reality we read 50\%, programmed 40\% and wrote 10\% of the work time.
It is also visible that we didn't manage to complete three milestones in time. This was caused by different circumstances, but we managed to complete the entire project in time because we adjusted our planning every few weeks.

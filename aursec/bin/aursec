Verify package sources by checking their hashes against a blockchain.
If BUILD_DIR is not set, or -, read from STDIN.

Options:
  -h, --help         Show this help message.
  -v, --verbose      Enable additional output.
  -c, --check-only   Never submit hashes to the blockchain.
  -s, --status-only  Only output critical errors and never prompt the user.

Exit status:
  0  if OK,
  64 if the initialization failed,
  65 if there was a problem contacting the chain,
  66 if no hash was found,
  67 if a hash was found, but it doesn't match the consensus.
